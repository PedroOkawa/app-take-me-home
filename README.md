# Take me home

![Workflow result](https://github.com/PedroOkawa/app-take-me-home/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
An application that helps you take some cute friend home


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I'm pretty bad at designing layouts, but I guess the card is not that bad, at least. :thinking:
And I tried to follow a clean architecture approach by separating data (Repositories), domain (Use cases) and ui (View Model and composable) layers and using Hilt DI to manage dependencies.
